# XBT 0.2.0
XBT will be separated out into the language and the appliction. I think I will try to create an auto-compile-tool like CMake which uses XBTLang (for now) to decide it's next actions.

As of right now, XBT the application is 0% implemented and XBTLang is at version 0.1.0 working its way to 0.2.0.

## 0.2.0 Known Bugs
## [parser-error][16:17] Unimplementd type: :, type: 10
This happens most likely when the user mixes up the syntax of a user
defined member and a designated member.

Below is an example of how to get this error.
```
$exit_message: "Done compiling!"     .
```
The user meant to write `$exit_message = "Done compiling!"`.

**Problem:** This is a terrible error message for such a common mistake.  
**Solution:** Expect this error and provide the user with a better error message.




## 0.2.0 Language Feature Goals
Below are some feature I'm thinking of implementing for 
### 0.2.0 Statement Enders
The new syntax for ending a statement will be the period instead of
the semicolon.
```enbf
/* New */
statement := expr '.' ;
/* Old */
statement := expr ';' ;
```
### 0.2.0 Keywords
In 0.1.0, some variables were treated like keywords. However, In 
0.2.0, they will be converted to keywords. Below is a syntax comparison as well as a list of said keywords.

```ebnf
/* New */
keyword := KEYWORD (STRING)+ ;
/* Old */
keyword := VAR (STRING)+ ;

/* New Keywords */
KEYWORD := "build_files"
           | "output_files"
           | "watch_files" ;

VAR := "$"IDENT ;
```

### 0.2.0 Rule Members
I would like to give the user the ability to access variables within each `rule`. Think `{"main": {"clean": "$ rm -rf /"}}`.
Below will be the syntax:
```ebnf
rule_member = RULE '::' VAR ;
```


### 0.2.0 Auto XBT
For something like a C project, you could create these files
automatically by searching through a directory, mapping the
unique file names (minus the extention) to a `rule`. In order
to do this, I'm going to need to implement a couple of things.

** 0.2.0 Global Scope**
In the "0.2.0 Code" section below, everything until the Main
rule is a global variable. I think they will make the output
`.xbt` files more uniform. Their syntax will be:
```ebnf
global_variable = '$'CAPITAL_IDENT '=' STRING ;
```

**0.2.0 xbt init and xbt.lock and xbt.settings**  
TODO  

**xbt clean**  
TODO  

**xbt compile**  
TODO


## 0.2.0 Code
```
/* Can't get rid of the ';'. They are required
 * for knowing when to stop when assigning/declaring 
 * multiple values.
 * I could probably figure out how to change the syntax
 * but I think the semicolons look better than adding a list
 * structure.
 */
$MAIN   = "main"     .
$MAIN_C = "${MAIN}.c".
$MAIN_H = "${MAIN}.h".
$MAIN_O = "${MAIN}.o".

$HELPER   = "helper"     .
$HELPER_C = "${HELPER}.c".
$HELPER_H = "${HELPER}.h".
$HELPER_O = "${HELPER}.o".

rule  Main  {
    /* `bin` would be a keyword that would 
        * give this info */
    output_files: bin                        .
    build_files : $MAIN_C Helper::build_files.
    watch_files : $MAIN_H                    .
    clean       : bin Helper::clean          .

    $ gcc -o $output_files $build_files
}

rule Helper {
    output_files: $HELPER_O   .
    build_files : $HELPER_C   .
    watch_files : $HELPER_H   .
    clean       : output_files.

    $ gcc -o $output_files -c $build_files
}

/* This is the 'pseudo code' for how I would implement
    * `xbt clean`.
    * /
rule Clean {
    clean Main::clean.
}
```

## 0.0.1 AutoXBT
The main goal of 0.0.1 AXBT is to know how to search a directory,
find common C files, distinguish between `.h` files (`watch_files`), `.c` filess (`build_files`), and `.o` or `bin` files (`output_files`).

The idea is that it will read the files in a directory and find all the unique files names (excluding the extention) and create rules for each of them appropriately assigning them to their correct categories.

The only issue from the outset is knowing the entry point or the 'All' rule. This could be remedied with an `xbt init [entry-file]`
command which would save this information in an `.xbt/xbt.lock` file.

Another issue is knowing of nested dependencies. For example, we
need to know what the dependencies are for `main.c`. The obvious dependencies could be `main.c`, `main.h`, and `main.o`. But suppose `main.c` included `other.h`. AXBT would need to read the includes for `main.c` and include them as dependencies for `rule Main {}`.

**Directory Layout**
```
project-name
|_ main.c
|_ other.o
|_ other.c
|_ other.h
```

**main.c**
```c
#include "other.h"

int main(void) {
    return 1;
}
```

**build.xbt**
- Reads includes for `main.c` and sees `#include "other.h"`.
- Finds all the `other.*` in the directory where `other.c` is.
- Creates an Other rule for them.
```
rule All {
    build_files: "main.c" Other.build_files ;

    $ gcc some command
}

rule Other {
    /* Finds these files for you */
    build_files : "other.c" "other.o"

    $ gcc create object file
}
```

## 0.1.0 AXBT Commands
- `xbt init [entry_file_path]`
- `xbt clean`


# Draft Auto-XBT Idea
## 0.2.0 New Feature Descriptions
3. It would be neat to create a program that creates these files
   for every directory in a C project and climbs back up to the
   projects root and runs them all. These files are so repetetive for a C project, you could write a program to do it. For each directory, find your .h, .c, .o, etc files and
   create this file for them where only the constants need to change.
4. `xbt clean:` Think for c: Searches a directory and finds all
    the .c, .h. .o, etcs files and creates a rule for them like:

    1. Search directory.  `files == [ "main.c" "helper.c, "helper.h", "helper.o"]`
    2. Filter for unique names.  `filtered = files.unique()`

    3. Somehow know the entry file name. 
        - `xbt init`: have a `xbt.lock` file which defines `{"entry": "/path/to/main.c"}`.

    4. Remove the entry file from that list.

    5. Create a rule for each one of those unique
          elements.

    6.  Assuming we have a `xbt.lock` file that specfied that the entry point was main.c... `{"entry": "path/to/main.c" }`.
    - change `$keywords = VALUE` into `keywords : VALUE`. (E.g. $output_files -> output_files)
    - global scope/variables: Need to implement this.
    - `bin`: Provides paths to all binary outputs of the project.
             entry will be provided, but the  .lock file could
             contain more or something.
5. A user can provide a dictionary defining how to clean unknown
files types
```
{
    "clean" : { 
        "file-types" : {
            "h": "rm"
        }
    },
    "settings": {
        "remove-directories": false,
    }
}
```
