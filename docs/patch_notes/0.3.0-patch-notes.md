## Syntax Updates
**Member Declaration/Assignment**  
All members are assigned the same way now. Distinguished Members
such as `build_files` and `$@` will be visually distinguished from
other members using syntax highlighting.

If a user tries to declare a member with the same name as any of
the designated members, then an error will be thrown.

Designated Member Names:
- build_files
- $^
- output_files
- $@

## Design Notes
**Member Reassignment**  
If a user tries to reassign any value to an existing member, let
them. For me, this would be an accident and I'd like an error to be
thrown. However, there might be a use case for it. I'll hold off
on the error/warning message until it becomes an annoying mistake.
