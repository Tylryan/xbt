# 0.2.0 XBT Lang
## Syntax Updates
Assigning nothing to a keyword or variable is now a syntax error caught by the parser.
```
/* Incorrect */
build_files : .
$my_var = .
/* Correct */
build_files : "a.c" "b.o" .
$my_var = "somethign" build_files .
```

## Global Variables
```
$PROJECT_DIR = "examples/c_project" .

rule Entry {
    build_files: "${PROJECT_DIR}/main.c"
                 Helper::$output_files    .
    $ echo $build_files
}

rule Helper {
    build_files: "${PROJECT_DIR}/helper.c"  .
    output_files: "${PROJECT_DIR}/helper.o" .

    $ gcc -o $output_files -c $build_files
}


```
## Forward Referencing Rule Members
The user can now forward reference Rules and their members. This makes declaring 'build_files' a little easier now that you can reference a variable instead of retyping them all. In the example
below, the Entry rule declares it's build files to be:
1) ..."main.c"
2) Helper::$output_files

```
rule Entry {
    $project_dir  = "examples/c_project"      .
    /* Below, 'Helper' would return 
     * "examples/c_project/helper.o" */
    build_files  : "${project_dir}/main.c" 
                    Helper::$output_files  .
    output_files : "${project_dir}/a.out"  .

    /* You can access local members within
     * the shell... */
    $ gcc -o $output_files $build_files

    /* As well as members of other Rules */
    $ echo Helper outputs:  Helper::$output_files
}

/* This rule would always run as it doesn't 
 * declare 'build_files'. 
 */
rule Helper {
    $project_dir  = "examples/c_project"      .
    output_files : "${project_dir}/helper.o"  .

    $ echo "Running Helper"
}
```

# `!` Helper Files Syntax
This allows you to define helper files as 
inputs which will be used to compare modified
times just like other build files. However,
when build_files is referenced, they will not appear.
```
build_files: "animal.c" !"animal.h" .
$ gcc $^

OUTPUT
gcc hello.c
```
